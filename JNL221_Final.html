			The estimated arrests for violent and property crimes in the United States are similar across age groups. However, young adults are slightly more likely to commit violent crimes than adults. Of the violent crimes young adults, those 18 to 24 years old, committed, the most frequent was aggravated assault. Robbery and murder and nonnegligent manslaughter were also high on the list of violent crimes committed by young offenders. Those in the 0 to 17 age group are significantly more likely to commit murder or nonnegligent manslaughter than any other age group, with them accounting for 95% of all violent crimes committed. The chance that someone arrested in the 18-20 year age range committed robbery instead of other violent crimes was also significantly higher than in other age ranges. However, this data is not comprehensive. The FBI and Bureau for Justice Statistics get their data from federal, state, city, and county police departments and interviews. Although truly complete data on this subject is nearly impossible to obtain, the FBI and the Bureau of Justice Statistics came to the same conclusion. Property crime is much more common than violent crime. The most common property crimes are larceny and theft, burglary, motor vehicle theft. The most common violent crimes are aggravated assault, robbery, rape, and murder/nonnegligent manslaughter. I talked to Teresa Bomkamp, assistant prosecuting attorney for St. Louis county, who primarily handles sexual assault, child abuse, and homicide cases, about this data.		</div>

			From what she has seen through her work and other people’s in her office, drug and lower-level often lead to higher level, more severe crimes. However, the increase in violent offenses in recent years has risen and is associated with guns and the accessibility to them, “Everybody has a gun, they can get guns easily, and the mentality is solving problems with guns. It used to be when I was younger, and especially my parents were younger, you have a problem with someone you might get punched in the face, now you might get shot in the head,” as well as the increase in access and use of controlled substances. Bomkamp talks about how big the focus of her office is their diversion program and trying to help the offenders who do start with lower-level crime before it escalates. “They do a lot of diversion programs, not for violent crime but for people arrested for drug offenses and things like that. They’re trying to get to them and the root of the problem and help them before it keeps just being conviction after conviction after conviction and escalating to more serious crime.” The difference between violent crime and property crime varies dramatically based on location. Some of the determining factors of this are the population’s density and economic condition. However, not all crimes are reported, and most of the crimes reported are not solved. According to the FBI and the BJS, in 2019, only an estimated 40.9% of violent crimes and 32.5% of property crimes were reported, while police nationwide closed only 45.5% of those noted violent crimes and 17.2% of property crimes. Those younger and who have a lower income are much more likely to report being victims of a crime than older, wealthier people. This rate has remained relatively stable for decades. While the rate of crimes solved has remained relatively the same, the age of those committing crimes has been getting younger and younger, according to Bomkamp and what she has seen, “That is, and I’m not involved in the diversion program, but that is something that our office is trying to put a lot of time into, trying to stop before it escalates. So it’s not just the pipeline to prison. They can stop it and help them, people starting with this life of crime. Then again, in the types of cases I handle, sexual assault, you will see a forty-five-year-old man with a clean record, and you think what? Where did this come from? But then, at that point, we also are concerned, not every crime is caught. People commit crimes all of the time and aren’t caught. But I think in general drug cases, property crime, and robbery, you often see it escalate. But I think more and more also with all of the guns on the street, and you can see it watching the news too, a 15-year-old robbed a shopper at gunpoint. Like 15?! Did they start with robbery? But I think it’s getting younger and younger.” And according to Princeton sociologist Patrick Sharkey, “The rise in violence in 2020 appears to be almost entirely a rise in gun violence, rather than a more general increase in all forms of crime.” Guns account for approximately two-thirds of homicides year to year in the U.S. However, in 2020, firearms accounted for 77% of all homicides. This data backs up my research with crime rates remaining relatively consistent through age groups, except those ages zero to seventeen committing violent crimes are much more likely than the other age groups to commit murder and nonnegligent manslaughter.
